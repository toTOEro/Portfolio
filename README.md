This website is deployed at the following link: https://totoero.github.io/Portfolio/

This project is entirely comprised of CSS and HTML language. Overall, the content is presentable however I would like to further improve upon it's design to become more unique/visually pleasing.

The HTML and CSS code can either be viewed using Google Chrome's developer tools, or by opening the repository files in VSCode.
